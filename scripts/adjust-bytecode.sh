# Need to replace the instructions as explained here: https://github.com/qmonnet/rbpf/blob/main/examples/load_elf.rs
# This feels sketchy but apparently the linux kernel does that as well.
# The purpose of this manipulation is to replace the instructions responsible
# for loading the packet data as 4-byte words for instructions that will load
# 8-byte double words (instructions staring with 0x79).
# Further, we need to change the offset at which the pointer to the packet
# data is stored as the values produced by clang would cause the addresses to
# overlap
#
# TODO: make this work for all programs
# Investigate: is this actually needed for all memory loads?
# Check: how is it actually done in the linux kernel?
# Reach out to Quentin.

# Effectively all instructions starting with 61 need to be replaced by 79
